I'm a 1st year doctor student from the [Laboratory for System Dependability](https://www.sd.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/#laboratory) at the University of Tsukuba, Japan. My supervisor is [Prof. Fumio Machida](https://www.sd.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/machida.html). 

Research Interest
======
- Reliability of UAV Systems
- Stochastic Models for Dependability Analysis
- System Performance Evaluation
- Software Reliability Evaluation and Design

Recently, I am also actively expanding the development of UAV simulation tools (such as AirSim from Microsoft) and the latest technologies that can be applied to drones (such as AI-agent).
